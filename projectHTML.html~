        <div class="text">Greetings! I'm Asie, a 15-year-oldgirl from the city of Temryuk, born on June 12, 2008. Currently being a student of 9th grade at Sennoy's School number 8, I've formed a passion for the arts since my early years.
Being on a seven-year journey through the world of choreography, I successfully graduated from choreography school. Art school also supported my interest in drawing and handicrafts since childhood. Music, an inseparable part of my life, adds a harmonious touch to my daily life.
Beyond the art, my heart beats for animals. I've dedicated my efforts to feed and shelter homeless animals. At the age of 10, I helped 13 cats who had no home. My journey as a volunteer in 6th grade further deepened my commitment to making good things.
Nowadays, Iâ€™m dedicated to studying, preparing for exams. I really enjoy studying physics and computer science. Physics is fascinating to me, and I don't just learn about it in school. I take extra classes to explore it more. This helps me follow what I love and sets the stage for what I want to do in the future.
I'm also interested in architecture. Even though I haven't figured out exactly where I want to go in this field, I'm drawn to it. Come along with me on this exciting journey of creativity, learning, and pursuing what I love!</div>
